### Overview

An important component of the SMARTA and Ataper projects is the eventual incorporation of user-generated feedback as an organic, discrete source of system events, behaviors, alerts, and foibles. This data source would service the needs of ostensibly ephemeral impact events for the system and ultimately feed a data warehouse for BI analysis. 

The conceit of the story is that primary sources of truth are fundamentally invalidated or otherwise eroded by one-off events that are unaccounted for in the existing API.

Our exaxmple for our first iteration is a riff on the Waze-style user feedback system.
