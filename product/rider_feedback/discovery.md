### Overview

An important component of the SMARTA and Ataper projects is the eventual incorporation of user-generated feedback as an organic, discrete source of system events, behaviors, alerts, and foibles. This data source would service the needs of ostensibly ephemeral impact events for the system and ultimately feed a data warehouse for BI analysis. 

The conceit of the story is that primary sources of truth are fundamentally invalidated or otherwise eroded by one-off events that are unaccounted for in the existing API.

### Goals

Our exaxmple for the first iteration is a riff on the Waze-style user feedback system with the key characteristics:

* Pre-defined event categories.
* A confirm/deny system for each event to invalidate out-of-date/resolved incidents.
* Pre-emptive visual representation at impacted stations/lines.
* Traceability to individual rides and riders. 

Some stretch and open-ended goals and consequences of this initiative: 

* Rider login system (OpenID?)
* Tracked user preferences.
* Cacched seaerches/previous trips.
